\chapter*{abstract}

\noindent  Software architectures is a complex field to be studied,
because it involves not only technological aspects, but also human
problems, like knowledge of concepts and conceptions used to apply
and maintain a system developed in the architecture in question.
Microservices is an example of an architecture that tries to solve
some recurrent problems in other architectures related to the knowledge
baggage over a certain system required to alter or add a new functionality.
This paper seeks to study and apply this architecture to develop an server
administration interface. During the development of this paper, some
technology and components studied to implement the system are listed,
identifying which did not meet the requirements and which were applied.
In sequence, it is presented the final architecture, showing the components
and interactions between them to expose the functionalities of the system.
Lastly, the results of the project are presented, where is described the
facilities of management, maintenance of the code, scalability and failure
tolerance which were implemented, in addition to future improvements.
